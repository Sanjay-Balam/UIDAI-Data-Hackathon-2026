## 🇮🇳 The "Money Shot": India Choropleth Maps
> **The Chart**: `map_state_sps.html` & `map_state_clcs.html`
> **Why it wins**: Judges love maps. It shows you understand the *National Scale* of the problem.

### 💡 Your Winning Argument (Copy-Paste):
"Our State-Level analysis reveals a clear North-South divide. As seen in the *Service Pressure Heatmap*, States like **[Insert Red State Name]** are facing double the transaction load per PIN code compared to the national average. This visual evidence warrants an immediate allocation of the 'Strategic Reserve' of kits to these high-pressure states."

## 📈 The "Velocity" Insight
> **The Chart**: `trend_national_velocity.html`
> **Why it wins**: It proves demand is *dynamic*, invalidating static planning.

### 💡 Your Winning Argument:
"The *National Velocity Trend* proves that Aadhaar demand is not flat. We observe a sharp **[Insert % Growth]** spike in **[Insert Month]** (likely correlated with school admissions). UIDAI's current 'fixed center' model wastes capacity in low months and crashes in high months. We propose a 'Elastic Staffing Model' based on this predictive curve."

## 🎯 The "Child Risk" Quadrant
> **The Chart**: `chart_district_risk_scatter.html`
> **Why it wins**: It is a novel, humanitarian metric that protects children.

### 💡 Your Winning Argument:
"We developed the *Child Lifecycle Compliance Score (CLCS)* to catch 'Silent Exclusion'. The scatter plot identifies 'Ghost Districts' (Bottom-Right) where child activity is high, but biometric updates are near zero. These children are at imminent risk of ID deactivation. We recommend targeted SMS campaigns in these specific PIN codes."
